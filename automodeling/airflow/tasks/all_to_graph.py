"""Module for the `all_to_graph` task using previous task output to generate a graph.

This task leverage scenarios and ontology generated during previous tasks to automodel
a computable contract graph representation.

it contains:
    * :func:`all_to_graph`: actual logic taking an ontology str and scenarios str and
        producing a graph.
    * :func:`all_to_graph_task`: a decorated airflow task wrapping the logic to be used
        in the DAG.
