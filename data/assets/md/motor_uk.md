## AUTOMATICALLY

## RENEWING THE POLICY

If you purchased a Motor Break- down policy from us within the last few years, your policy may be set to automatically renew, to ensure you continue to benefit from cover.
If this is the case, we will have informed you, and will remind you in our communi- cations to you.

You have the right to opt out of auto- matic renewal at any time, although if you wish to do this please do so before 15 days prior to your renewal date, to ensure we do not take further payments.

Regardless of whether you have cho- sen to opt out, or remain on automatic renewal for ease, we will send you a renewal reminder about 28 days before your policy is due to expire, to advise you of the cost of renewing your policy for another year, and explain any changes to the policy that may take effect at renewal.

If you have chosen to opt out: Once you receive the reminder you will need to contact us if you wish to renew your policy, and make payment.
Otherwise, your policy will end without renewing and you will not be covered for any event taking place after the end of your period of insurance.

If you have not opted out: We will collect payment for another year of cover using the same payment details which you gave us previously, unless you instruct us otherwise.

If you opt out of automatic renewal, you may also opt back in at any time by contacting us.

To opt out of automatic renewal, contact us by phone on 0800 169 0206 or via e-mail on web.sales@axa-assistance.co.uk

If we have not informed you of automatic renewal in our communications, your policy does not have this option and you will need to confirm if you wish to renew each year.

## CANCELLATION RIGHTS

If you find that this cover does not meet your needs, please contact us on 0800 169 0206 within 14 days of receiving this document and we will cancel this policy.
You will receive a refund of your premium as long as you have not made any claims.

If you cancel the policy outside the 14-day period, you will receive a refund of your premium proportionate to the amount of time left to run on the policy, less an administrative charge of £15 as long as you have not made any claims.

We may cancel this policy by giving you at least seven days’ notice at your last- known address.
If we cancel the policy, we will refund the premium paid for
