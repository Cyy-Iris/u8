Covered Persons are not obliged to accept any of the benefits of this insurance.
If a Covered Person makes a claim under the Policy then such person will have the same obligations to Us as if they were the Policyholder and We will have the same rights against the Covered Persons as we would have against the Policyholder.

Nothing prevents such persons from entering into other arrangements regarding insurance.

Note, any continuation benefits shall not exceed the total maximum benefit period as shown in the Schedule.
